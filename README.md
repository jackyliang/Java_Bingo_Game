# Java Bingo Game

## Introduction

A simple single-player Bingo game written in Java for Drexel's ECE 203 Introduction to Java Final Exam. Running simply BINGOFINAL.java will print to Java output. Running MakeCard.java will give you a graphical user interface. All three classes are required in order to run the game.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/jackyliang/Java_Bingo_Game.git
    
## To run

    Load the classes up to your favorite IDE and just click run. This was before I learned about compiling and running with Ant in the CLI
    
## License

    This is school code, so if you're a student and this is your school assignment, I highly recommend you do it yourself and not copy the code, both for legal, moral, and ethical reasons. But hey, I'm not stopping you!
